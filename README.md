# Neural_Network_Plasticity_Modeling
The code embeds a neural network within a 3D elastoplastic material model to learn unknown evolution laws for backstress and isotropic hardening while enforcing thermodynamic consistency. By training on stress-strain data, it can recover known laws from synthetic data and discover new, physically consistent evolution laws from experiments.
